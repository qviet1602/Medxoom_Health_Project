Instructions on how and what to run first among all the notebooks.

Please download python version 3.7 or above and all the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file to able to run all the code files.

The GT_analysis folder and modeling contains all codes required to build data pipeline, run models and output result.
Installation: Please download datasets and codes, and do not modify the relative directory of files.
Execution: No command line needed to run the code, open codes in Jupyter Notebook and run the codes.
1. run the code files in GT_analysis folder to generate the final data sets and finally the merge_all_data notebook to merge all the data into a single file.
2. modeling_regression.ipynb: A set of regression models trained to predict relative price of inpatient and out patient service.
3. modeling_classification.ipynb: A set of classification models trained to predict "low","medium", "high" class of the relative price.
4. labelling_unlabelled_data.ipynb: Predicting the unlabeled data in original dataset.
